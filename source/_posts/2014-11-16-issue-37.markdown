Another Monday, another HockeyStickWeekly,

## How To Increase User Retention During The Free Trial Period
Many SaaS companies use "free trial" as a sales technique. And a good technique that is, it's risk free, try before you buy. Point is, the SaaS provider needs to do everything within its power to make sure the free trialer is converted into a paying customer. This article gives some good suggestion on how to do that.

## Product Splintering: How we Generated $188,674 from a Dead Email List and a Tired Offer

## How to Use Autoresponders to Accelerate Your Growth
Interesting article on "autoresponders". An autoresponder is a series of emails, usually focused on a specific topic, delivered in a pre-determined sequence at pre-determined intervals. The process can begin when someone subscribes to your general email list. It's an automated way to deliver value and build trust. I have used autoresponders on [leanpricing.co](http://leanpricing.co) with great success, so I can only say: try it out for yourselves!
