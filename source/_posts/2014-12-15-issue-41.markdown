Hi there,

It's that time of year again, closing projects and loose ends before Christmas, hence the delay of your beloved Hockey Stick Weekly. Hopefully these articles make it up.

## Growth Hacking Quick Wins
Huge slide deck (198 slides) full of down to earth tips and tricks for you growth hackers out there. I scrolled to it 5 times at least the last couple of days, and always stumble upon new little insights. Highly recommended.

## Why Growth Hacking Can Kill Your Startup
Clear and to the point article on the dangers of growth hacking before you reached Product/Market fit. Or, as David Ogilvy once said: "Nothing kills a bad product faster than good advertising."

## The One-Slide Update Deck
Good investors follow up on how their startups are doing, help them out, want them to measure progress and raise issues when they happen. In this blog post <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=@chrija">@chrija</a> introduces a one slide Powerpoint that can be used in a monthly call to follow up on progress and issues. It's probably a good idea to implement such a 1 slide overview anyway.

## How to Host a Meetup For Your Community: The Who, What, Where, When, And How
Interesing article on community building through meetups. I myself witnessed first hand the dawn of 2 popular meetups in Belgium (with http://www.meetup.com/Growth-Hacking-Belgium/ as the biggest and most active one) and recognize lot's of the tips in this article as things we did right ourselves too.
