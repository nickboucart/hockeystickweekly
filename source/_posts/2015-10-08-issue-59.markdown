    title: Your SaaS Metrics Are Wrong if You Include These Customers
    description: "A bit of an advanced blog post, I have to admit, but one I can truly relate to. [Lincoln Murphy](http://twitter.com/lincolnmurphy) discusses churn, and illustrates that you shouldn't be fooling yourselves by taking into account customers that can't churn or too early customers into your churn calculations. His simple number examples illustrate how a churn rate of 10% becomes one of 14% if you calculate it properly."

    title: "8 Customer Discovery Questions To Validate Product Market Fit For Your Startup"
    description: "Super interesting article by [@ttunguz ](https://twitter.com/ttunguz) on how he does customer diligence when preparing for an investment in a company. Couple of questions he asks: _How did you here about the product?_ or _What process did you use to pick this product over the competition?_ If you as a startup understand these questions, you'll definitely are in a good shape."

    description: "Elaborate article on how Hubspot launched their new products. Granted, they don't get the press coverage Apple or Tesla get when they announce new products, still, Hubspot does a great job too, and this article goes in great detail on telling exactly how they do it. "

    title: How We Know User Onboarding Is Really About The First Session
    description: "As a regular reader of the Hockey Stick Weekly, you know that I have something with onboarding. This article explains what onboarding is all about, and why it's so bloody important. Free personal pro tip: not sure how people react the first seconds they sign up? Install a tool like [inpectlet](http://www.inspectlet.com/) to record how users behave on your app and you'll probably feel very humble and learn a lot (I sure did ;) )"
